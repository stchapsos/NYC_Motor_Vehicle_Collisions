# New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis 2013-2023

## Analysts:
- Alexandros Plexidas
- Eirini Sigala
- Stelios Chapsos

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze historical data regarding motor vehicles accidents in New York City during the time period 2013-2023.

## Audience
The results of this analysis can be used by:
- **Urban Planners & Engineers**: To design and improve infrastructure that minimizes collision risks
- **Insurance Companies**: For designing insurance products that reflect the actual risk levels
- **General Public**: To raise awareness about road safety and encourage safer driving habits

## Topics Covered
We will cover topics such as:
- Borough Analysis
- Severity of collisions
- Collision Pattern over time

## Project Steps
The steps we took in this project were:
1. **Data collection** (Source: [Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes))
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
3. **Data Visualization**
4. **Insights**

## Tools Used
The tools we used for this project were:
1. Python (Pandas)
2. Power BI
3. ChatGPT

The analysis was mainly done on Power BI meaning all the graphs live there. (We will finetune this document in the future ðŸ˜Š)

## Key Insights
The most important insights we extracted were:
- New York City has taken significant steps to reduce the number of collisions through the Vision Zero initiative.
- While collisions have indeed dropped by a staggering 50% since 2019 and remained at those levels, the severity of collisions (injuries and fatalities) when they do happen remains at the same level.
- In the top 10 days with the most collisions, the weather was Snowstorm.
- The hour of day when most collisions happen is 5:00pm.
